# TODO
  - Add in progressive image loading
    - Questions:
      - How does prog work with display: none?
      - Will prog load the low-res before the images are expanded
  - Style
    - Questions:
      - Can we absolute position the close button to top? Side? Bottom?
      - Can we disappear close after you scroll past the final image?
      - How will this look on desktop?
      - Need simple icon to expand on 300-wide photo
